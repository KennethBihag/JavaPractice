> Solving 3 problems as part of our training assessment.

> Problem 1: There are a number of guests, each with their preferred
number of roommates (including themselves). Find the least number of rooms
to accommodate all guests.

> Problem 2: There is a line of boxes, some empty, some with a ball. Given
a number of balls at random locations, and that moving a ball to another box
counts as 1 move, find the least number of moves to make all balls sit next to
each other.

> Problem 3: Given a string, count the number of lowercase letters that appear
